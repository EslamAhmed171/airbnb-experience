# Airbnb Experience Web Page

This is my second project using React JS. In this project, I learned about the concept of props. The Airbnb Experience web page consists of three components: nav, hero, and card. The card component is designed with props to make it reusable. It fetches the data from data.js and creates new cards using this data in my App.js.

## Design

The design for this project was created using Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4YjrygFEXOcDp9AAnVFv7o/Airbnb-Experiences?node-id=0%3A1).
